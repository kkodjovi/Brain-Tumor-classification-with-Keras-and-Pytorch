# &nbsp;   # Brain Tumor classification using Resnet50 and a custom CNN model (Keras and Pytorch)

# 

# The goal of this project is to classify brain tumors from MRI images. I combine the power of ResNet50 (a pretrained model on ImageNet) with a custom CNN to leverage both transfer learning and feature extraction from this specific dataset

# 

# The dataset I used is available on \[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) and contains 4 classes : \*\*glioma\*\*, \*\*meningioma\*\*, \*\*pituitary tumor\*\* et \*\*no tumor\*\*.

# 

# This project was run on \*\*Google Colab\*\*, using a \*\*T4 GPU\*\* to accelerate the training.  

# 

# 

# I trained the model for \*\*10 epochs\*\*, and here are the results:

# 

# 

# | Metric          |    Combined Model   |

# |-----------------|---------------------|

# | Train Loss      | 0.1987              |

# | Train Accuracy  | 92.47%              |

# | Test Loss       | 0.1335              |

# | Test Accuracy   | 95.81%              |
